# Environment Variable Loading Fix

This implementation addresses the issue with Google API credentials not being properly loaded from the `.env` file, which was causing authentication failures with Google APIs.

## Implementation Instructions

### Step 1: Verify the Issue

Run the test script to verify the environment variable loading:

```bash
python test_env_loading.py
```

This will show:
- The initial state of the environment variables
- The state after using the direct loader
- The state after using python-dotenv
- The final state

### Step 2: Implement the Fix

You have two options:

#### Option A: Use the Direct Loader (Recommended)

1. Keep `load_env_variables.py` in the project root
2. Replace the current Google MCP Server with the fixed version:

```bash
cp google_mcp_server_fixed.py google_mcp_server.py
```

3. Start the server normally:

```bash
python google_mcp_server.py
```

#### Option B: Modify Existing Code

If you prefer to make minimal changes to the existing code:

1. Keep `load_env_variables.py` in the project root
2. Add this line at the very beginning of `google_mcp_server.py` (after imports):

```python
import load_env_variables
```

### Step 3: Verify the Fix

After implementing the fix, run the test connection function:

```python
# From Python
from google_mcp_server import GoogleMCPServer
server = GoogleMCPServer()
result = asyncio.run(server.test_google_connection())
print(result)
```

## How It Works

The solution addresses the environment variable loading issue by:

1. Creating a dedicated module that loads environment variables directly from the `.env` file
2. Ensuring variables are loaded before any imports that might use them
3. Providing better error handling and logging
4. Adding validation to verify environment variables are properly set

## Files in This Implementation

- **`load_env_variables.py`**: A standalone module that loads environment variables directly
- **`test_env_loading.py`**: A test script to verify environment variable loading
- **`google_mcp_server_fixed.py`**: A modified version of the Google MCP server with the fix implemented

## What's Next

After implementing this fix, the Google MCP Server should be able to properly authenticate with Google APIs using the credentials in the `.env` file.

If you continue to have issues, check:
1. The format of the `.env` file
2. That the credentials in the `.env` file are correct
3. That the `google_tokens.pickle` file exists and contains valid tokens
